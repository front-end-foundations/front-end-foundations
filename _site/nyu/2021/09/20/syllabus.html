</ul>

<h2 id="course-description">Course Description</h2>

<p>This rigorous, hands-on introduction to web design advances your development skills by showing you how standards-based HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript work together to create the modern web. Gain an introduction to techniques such as responsive design, progressive enhancement, and unobtrusive scripting that ensure superior results in all browsers—desktop, mobile, and app. Examine visual design and typography, and explore how to use Git for versioning and work groups, text editors (focusing on Sublime Text), CSS preprocessors, and contemporary frameworks such as Bootstrap.</p>

<h3 id="youll-walk-away-with">You’ll Walk Away with</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The tools and practical knowledge necessary to build visually rich, interactive web applications</li>
  <li>The skills to create easy-to-maintain, hand-crafted sites using a static site generator</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="course-prerequisites">Course Prerequisites</h3>

<p>An introduction to HTML is sufficient as a prerequisite although students can take the class with no prior knowledge of HTML, CSS or JavaScript. Basic fluency with the operating system of choice and with browsers is expected.</p>

<h3 id="course-structuremethod">Course Structure/Method</h3>

<p>This Class is given online via Zoom and meets twice weekly. Students should be prepared to use their own computer. Assignments will be given weekly and are documented in the course notes made available at each of the sessions.</p>

<h3 id="course-learning-outcomes">Course Learning Outcomes:</h3>

<p>By the end of this course, students will be able to create a semantically sound web page format that web page with Cascading Style Sheets, and add behaviors to it using JavaScript. Students will be able to deploy a multi-page static website on Netlify using Eleventy.</p>

<h3 id="communication-policy">Communication Policy</h3>

<p>Students should use my NYU email address - daniel.deverell@nyu.edu - for all communications. Responses will be received within 24 hours or one working day. Office Hours: 10 am to 5pm EST Monday through Friday. Request an appointment via email or on the class Slack channel.</p>

<h3 id="course-expectations">Course Expectations</h3>

<p>Attendance is key to achieving a successful outcome. Readings and homework will be assigned and are not mandatory but important to get the most from the class. Additionally, students must complete two assignments:</p>

<h4 id="midterm">Midterm</h4>

<p>For the midterm you will translate an image provided by the instructor into an HTML page and style it using CSS. This will be due on the 6th class.</p>

<h4 id="final-project">Final Project</h4>

<p>This project will be a series of web pages that incorporate CSS and JavaScript, deployed to Netlify via Github and developed using the static site generation concepts discussed in class. The project is due on the last day of classes.</p>

<h3 id="classroom-expectations">Classroom Expectations:</h3>

<p>As continuing education students, you are expected to conduct yourselves in a professional manner and engage and collaborate with your classmates in the Zoom meeting room. Here are our guiding principles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dress as if you are in the classroom.</li>
  <li>Keep your microphone muted unless asking a question or engaging in discussion.</li>
  <li>Check your video and audio when entering your class session.</li>
  <li>Minimize distractions which appear in the background around you.</li>
  <li>Look into the camera instead of looking at the screen.</li>
  <li>Type quietly, mute if necessary.</li>
  <li>Don’t eat during a Zoom class session and refrain from engaging in any activity such as smoking, consuming alcohol, etc. that you would not engage in if the class were in person.</li>
</ul>

<p>SPS classrooms are diverse and include students who range in age, culture, learning styles, and levels of professional experience. To maintain an inclusive environment that ensures all students can equally participate with and learn from each other, as well as receive feedback and instruction from faculty during group discussions in the classroom, all course-based discussions and group projects should occur in a language that is shared among all participants</p>

<h2 id="technology-policy">Technology Policy:</h2>

<p>All class sessions require use of Zoom.</p>

<p>The Github directory for this class is at https://github.com/front-end-foundations</p>

<h2 id="assessment-strategy">Assessment Strategy</h2>

<p>What ultimately matters in this course is not so much where you end up relative to your classmates but where you end up relative to yourself when you began.</p>

<p>Final project 50%
Midterm: 50%</p>

<p>Due to the nature of the subject material the contents of this syllabus are subject to change.</p>

Unless otherwise noted, grades will be posted in the online gradebook no later than the end of the week following the due date of the assignment. This university maintains a strict academic integrity policy. Please follow this link to read the policy related to plagiarism.</p>

<h3 id="academic-integrity-and-plagiarism-policy">Academic Integrity and Plagiarism Policy:</h3>

<p>All students are expected to be honest and ethical in all academic work. This trust is shared among all members of the University community and is a core principle of American higher education. Any breaches of this trust will be taken seriously. A hallmark of the educated student and good scholarship is the ability to acknowledge information derived from others. Students are expected to be scrupulous in crediting those sources that have contributed to the development of their ideas.</p>

<p>Plagiarism involves borrowing or using information from other sources without proper and full credit. Students are expected to demonstrate how what they have learned incorporates an understanding of the research and expertise of scholars and other appropriate experts; and thus recognizing others’ published work or teachings—whether that of authors, lecturers, or one’s peers—is a required practice in all academic projects. Students are subject to disciplinary actions for the following offenses which include but are not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cheating</li>
  <li>Plagiarism</li>
  <li>Forgery or unauthorized use of documents</li>
  <li>False form of identification</li>
</ul>
